Of course there’s another way to run kubectl commands from GitHub Actions.
For example using a kubeconfig file. The kubeconfig file contains information about the cluster,
including the API server endpoint, the cluster’s CA certificate, and the credentials for a user or service account. This is a way to authenticate and authorize kubectl to access a specific Kubernetes cluster. The best way to do this, is to add the kubeconfig file content as a secret in Github.
