# About me

Passionate developer.

Based in Vienna.

Always on the lookout for fresh challenges that push my boundaries and expand my skill set.

As a creative who values simplicity, I've designed my blog to be the digital equivalent of a business card: a concise and impactful introduction to who I am and what I'm about. It contains findings and information I encounter during my hobby projects or work.

If you're curious about my work or want to explore some coding together, feel free to check out my GitHub page at &nbsp; <Link aria-label="Link to my Github handle" href="https://github.com/cekocvetkov"><IoLogoGithub size={24}></IoLogoGithub> **cekocvetkov**</Link>&nbsp;. I'd love to learn from others and contribute to projects that make a positive impact.

Hope you like it!
